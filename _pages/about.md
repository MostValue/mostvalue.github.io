📚 I'm a third-year student at the University of Sydney.

🔬 My passion is applied deep learning, especially fields with high impact. I also am deeply passionate about building and aligning harmless, honest and helpful AI systems.

🤝 I'm always eager to learn from others and help out fellow machine learning enthusiasts, especially in the fields of AI Safety. Please reach out if you're working on something similar.

# 🔍 Currently Exploring

- Interpretability in large language models  
- Reinforcement learning methods, e.g. PPO for game playing
- Applications of SOTA AI methods towards traditional science problems, e.g. enyzme design
